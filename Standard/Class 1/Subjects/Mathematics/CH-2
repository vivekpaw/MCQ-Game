Chapter 2: What is Long? What is Round?
Classroom Activity

Ask children to play this game in the class. Let the children name two things — one long and one round. Every time, they should take the name of a new thing and avoid repetition.

For long objects, children may focus on one dimension (tall, wide, etc.).

Some may say a tumbler is long, while others may say it is round.

Both views should be considered, and children should explain their reasoning.

Song/Chant

Vidya didi asked all the children to sit in a circle.

My pencil box is long and my ball is round.
Look around, look around.
What is long? What is round?
Look around, look around.

My legs are long and my face is round.
Look around, look around.

A. Draw round objects and long objects.
B. Match the objects which are similar in shape.
C. Tick (✔) the shape which is similar to a ball.

Story: Wise Grandmother

Once there was a little lamb who was going to meet her grandmother.
The wolf saw the lamb and wanted to catch her.

Lamb: “Please don’t eat me now. Let me first go to my grandmother’s place and grow big.”

The lamb told her grandmother everything. The grandmother got an idea. She put the lamb inside a dholak and rolled it back to her house.

The dholak rolled very fast, and the wolf started running behind it. But the wolf could not catch the lamb, and she reached home safely.

Discussion:

Why did the dholak roll?

Talk about its shape and the inclined surface from the jungle to the house.
