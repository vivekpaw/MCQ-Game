### 4. Altitudes and Medians of a triangle
---------------------------------------------

**Let's recall.**

[cite_start]In the previous standard, we have learnt that the bisectors of angles of a triangle, as well as the perpendicular bisectors of its sides, are concurrent[cite: 4]. [cite_start]These points of concurrence are respectively called the **incentre** and the **circumcentre** of the triangle[cite: 5].

**Let's learn.**

### Altitude
[cite_start]The perpendicular segment drawn from a vertex of a triangle on the side opposite to it is called an **altitude** of the triangle[cite: 9]. [cite_start]In $\Delta$ ABC, segment AP is an altitude on the base BC[cite: 10].

**To draw altitudes of a triangle:**
1.  [cite_start]Draw any $\Delta$ XYZ[cite: 11].
2.  Draw a perpendicular from vertex X to the opposite side YZ using a set square. [cite_start]The segment XR is an altitude on side YZ[cite: 12, 13].
3.  [cite_start]Similarly, draw altitude YQ on side XZ and altitude ZP on side XY[cite: 14, 15].

[cite_start]The three altitudes of a triangle are concurrent (they pass through a single point)[cite: 18]. [cite_start]This point of concurrence is called the **orthocentre** of the triangle and is denoted by the letter 'O'[cite: 18, 19].

**Location of the Orthocentre:**
* [cite_start]The orthocentre of a **right-angled triangle** is the vertex of the right angle[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]The orthocentre of an **obtuse-angled triangle** is in the exterior of the triangle[cite: 61].
* [cite_start]The orthocentre of an **acute-angled triangle** is in the interior of the triangle[cite: 62].

### Median
[cite_start]The segment joining a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side is called a **median** of the triangle[cite: 65].

**To draw medians of a triangle:**
1.  [cite_start]Draw $\Delta$ АВС[cite: 73].
2.  [cite_start]Find the midpoint P of side AB and draw segment CP[cite: 74].
3.  [cite_start]Similarly, find the midpoints Q of BC and R of AC, and draw segments AQ and BR[cite: 75, 79].

[cite_start]The medians of a triangle are concurrent[cite: 84]. [cite_start]Their point of concurrence is called the **centroid** and is denoted by 'G'[cite: 84]. [cite_start]The centroid is always located in the **interior** of the triangle, regardless of the triangle type[cite: 95].

**Property of the Centroid:**
[cite_start]The centroid divides each median in the ratio **2:1**[cite: 96].
