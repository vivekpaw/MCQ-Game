### 9. Discount and Commission
---------------------------------

**Let's learn.**

### Discount
When selling an item, a shopkeeper might reduce the price to attract customers or clear old stock. This reduction in price is called a **discount**.

* **Marked Price (M.P.)**: The price printed on the tag of an item.
* **Discount**: The amount by which the marked price is reduced.
* **Selling Price (S.P.)**: The price the customer pays after the discount.

The relationship is:
**Selling Price = Marked Price - Discount**

Discount is often expressed as a percentage. A 20% discount means the marked price is reduced by 20%. [cite_start]For example, on an item marked at ₹100, the discount is ₹20, and the selling price becomes ₹80. [cite: 399, 400, 401]

### Commission
Sometimes, a person or company (an agent) helps sell goods on behalf of a manufacturer or owner. [cite_start]For this service, the agent receives a remuneration called **commission**. [cite: 520, 521] [cite_start]The person who brings a seller and a buyer together is also known as a 'mediator' or 'commission agent' and gets a commission for the job. [cite: 525, 526, 528]

* [cite_start]**Commission Agent**: A person who provides the service of selling goods for others. [cite: 523]
* [cite_start]Commission is typically calculated as a percentage of the selling price. [cite: 523]

**Example:**

* [cite_start]Brokerage from one party = $250000 \times \frac{2}{100} = ₹5000$. [cite: 533]
* [cite_start]Total brokerage received = $5000 + 5000 = ₹10000$. [cite: 535]
