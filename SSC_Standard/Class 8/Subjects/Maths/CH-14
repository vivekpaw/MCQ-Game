### 14. Compound Interest
-----------------------------

**Let's recall.**

**Simple Interest** is the additional money paid on a loan or investment. It is calculated using the formula:
* [cite_start]**Formula**: $I = \frac{PNR}{100}$ [cite: 281]
    * [cite_start]Where $I$ = Interest, $P$ = Principal, $N$ = Number of years, and $R$ = Rate of interest p.c.p.a. [cite: 282]

**Let's learn.**

### Compound Interest
**Compound Interest** is calculated on the principal amount plus the accumulated interest from previous periods. [cite_start]If a borrower fails to pay the interest for one year, the bank adds that interest to the principal, and the next year's interest is calculated on this new, larger principal. [cite: 294, 295, 296]

The formula to calculate the final amount (A) with compound interest is:
* [cite_start]**Formula**: $A = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^N$ [cite: 322]
    * [cite_start]Where $A$ = Amount, $P$ = Principal, $R$ = Rate of interest p.c.p.a., and $N$ = Number of years. [cite: 321]
* [cite_start]**Compound Interest (C.I.)** = Amount (A) - Principal (P) [cite: 330, 332]

**Practice Set 14.1**

1.  Find the amount and the compound interest for the following:
| No. | Principal (₹) | Rate (p.c.p.a.) | Duration (years) |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1   | 2000          | 5               | 2                |
| 2   | 5000          | 8               | 3                |
| 3   | 4000          | 7.5             | 2                |

2.  Sameerrao has taken a loan of ₹12,500 at a rate of 12 p.c.p.a. for 3 years. [cite_start]If the interest is compounded annually, how much should he pay to clear his loan? [cite: 337, 339]

3.  To start a business, Shalaka has taken a loan of ₹8000 at a rate of $10\frac{1}{2}$ p.c.p.a. [cite_start]After two years, how much compound interest will she have to pay? [cite: 340, 342]

### Application of the Compound Interest Formula
[cite_start]The compound interest formula is also used in other fields, such as calculating population growth or the **depreciation** (reduction in value) of an asset like a vehicle or machine. [cite: 357, 358, 359] [cite_start]For depreciation, the rate (R) is taken as negative because the value decreases. [cite: 364]

**Example: Population Growth**
The population of a city was 2,50,000 in 2010 and increases at a compounding rate of 8% per year. [cite_start]Find the population in 2012. [cite: 365, 366]
* **Solution**: Here, $P = 2,50,000$, $R = 8$, $N = 2$.
    * [cite_start]$A = 250000 \times (1 + \frac{8}{100})^2 = 2,91,600$. [cite: 372]
    * [cite_start]The population in 2012 will be 2,91,600. [cite: 374]

**Example: Depreciation**
Rehana purchased a scooter for ₹60,000 in 2015. Its value falls by 20% every year. [cite_start]What will be its price after 2 years? [cite: 376, 377]
* **Solution**: Here, $P = 60,000$, $R = -20$ (since it's depreciation), $N = 2$.
    * [cite_start]$A = 60000 \times (1 - \frac{20}{100})^2 = ₹38,400$. [cite: 384, 385]
    * [cite_start]The price after two years will be ₹38,400. [cite: 386]
