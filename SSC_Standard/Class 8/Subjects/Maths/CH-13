---------------------------------

**Let's recall.**

* [cite_start]Figures that exactly coincide with each other are called **congruent figures**. [cite: 901]
* [cite_start]Line segments of equal length are congruent. [cite: 902]
* [cite_start]Angles of equal measure are congruent. [cite: 903]

**Let's learn.**

### Congruence of Triangles

[cite_start]Two triangles are congruent if their vertices can be matched in a one-to-one correspondence such that all corresponding sides and angles are equal. [cite: 907, 917, 918]

[cite_start]If $\Delta ABC$ is congruent to $\Delta PQR$ under the correspondence $A \leftrightarrow P, B \leftrightarrow Q, C \leftrightarrow R$, it is written as $\Delta ABC \cong \Delta PQR$. [cite: 920] This implies six congruences:
* $\angle A \cong \angle P$
* $\angle B \cong \angle Q$
* $\angle C \cong \angle R$
* seg $AB \cong$ seg $PQ$
* seg $BC \cong$ seg $QR$
* [cite_start]seg $CA \cong$ seg $RP$ [cite: 919]

[cite_start]The order of vertices in the congruence notation is crucial as it indicates the correct correspondence. [cite: 922]

### Tests for Congruence of Triangles

[cite_start]To prove that two triangles are congruent, it is not necessary to show that all six corresponding parts are congruent. [cite: 963] [cite_start]We can use tests that require proving only three specific corresponding parts are congruent. [cite: 964, 965]

1.  [cite_start]**SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Test:** If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to the two corresponding sides and included angle of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. [cite: 968, 1086]
2.  [cite_start]**SSS (Side-Side-Side) Test:** If three sides of one triangle are congruent to the three corresponding sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. [cite: 980, 1087]
3.  [cite_start]**ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Test:** If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to the two corresponding angles and included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. [cite: 990, 1088]
4.  [cite_start]**AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) Test:** If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding angles and side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. [cite: 1000, 1089]
5.  [cite_start]**Hypotenuse-Side Test:** If the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and corresponding side of another right-angled triangle, the triangles are congruent. [cite: 1004, 1090]

**Practice Set 13.1**

In each pair of triangles in the figures, parts bearing identical marks are congruent. [cite_start]State the test and the correspondence of vertices by which the triangles in each pair are congruent. [cite: 1055, 1056]

**Practice Set 13.2**

1.  In each pair of triangles given, parts shown by identical marks are congruent. State the test and the one-to-one correspondence of vertices by which the triangles are congruent. [cite_start]Also, list the remaining congruent parts. [cite: 1126, 1127]
2.  In the adjacent figure, seg $AD \cong$ seg $EC$. [cite_start]What additional information is needed to show that $\Delta ABD$ and $\Delta EBC$ will be congruent by the A-A-S test? [cite: 1143]
