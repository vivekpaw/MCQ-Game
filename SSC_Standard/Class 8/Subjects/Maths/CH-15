### 15. Area
-------------

**Let's recall.**

Here are some basic area formulas:
* [cite_start]**Area of a square** = $side^2$ [cite: 1481]
* [cite_start]**Area of a rectangle** = length × breadth [cite: 1482]
* [cite_start]**Area of a right-angled triangle** = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ product of sides making the right angle [cite: 1483, 1485, 1487]
* [cite_start]**Area of a triangle** = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ base × height [cite: 1489, 1490]

**Let's learn.**

### Area of a Parallelogram
A parallelogram can be rearranged to form a rectangle, showing that its area is calculated similarly. [cite_start]The area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and corresponding height. [cite: 1517]

* **Formula**: Area = base × height

**Practice Set 15.1**

1.  [cite_start]If the base of a parallelogram is 18 cm and its height is 11 cm, find its area. [cite: 1551]
2.  [cite_start]If the area of a parallelogram is 29.6 sq cm and its base is 8 cm, find its height. [cite: 1552]
3.  The area of a parallelogram is 83.2 sq cm. [cite_start]If its height is 6.4 cm, find the length of its base. [cite: 1553]

### Area of a Rhombus
[cite_start]The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, dividing it into four congruent right-angled triangles. [cite: 1569, 1573]

* [cite_start]**Formula**: Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ product of lengths of diagonals [cite: 1584, 1585]

---
**Practice Set 15.2**

1.  [cite_start]The lengths of the diagonals of a rhombus are 15 cm and 24 cm; find its area. [cite: 1623]
2.  [cite_start]The lengths of the diagonals of a rhombus are 16.5 cm and 14.2 cm; find its area. [cite: 1624]
3.  [cite_start]If the perimeter of a rhombus is 100 cm and the length of one diagonal is 48 cm, what is the area of the quadrilateral? [cite: 1625]
4.  [cite_start]If the length of a diagonal of a rhombus is 30 cm and its area is 240 sq cm, find its perimeter. [cite: 1626]

### Area of a Trapezium
A trapezium has one pair of parallel sides. Its area is calculated based on the lengths of these parallel sides and the perpendicular distance (height) between them.

* [cite_start]**Formula**: Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ (sum of the lengths of parallel sides) × height [cite: 1651, 1652]

---
**Practice Set 15.3**

1.  In trapezium ABCD, $l(AB) = 13$ cm, $l(DC) = 9$ cm, and $l(AD) = 8$ cm. [cite_start]Find the area of the trapezium. [cite: 1668, 1669, 1673]
2.  The lengths of the two parallel sides of a trapezium are 8.5 cm and 11.5 cm, and its height is 4.2 cm. [cite_start]Find its area. [cite: 1676]

### Area of a Triangle (Heron's Formula)
When the height of a triangle is not known, but the lengths of all three sides (a, b, c) are, we can use **Heron's Formula** to find its area.

First, calculate the **semiperimeter (s)**:
* [cite_start]$s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$ [cite: 1703]

Then, use the formula:
* [cite_start]**Formula**: Area = $\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$ [cite: 1704]

**Practice Set 15.4**

1.  The sides of a triangle are 45 cm, 39 cm, and 42 cm. [cite_start]Find its area. [cite: 1755]
2.  [cite_start]Look at the measures shown in the adjacent figure and find the area of ☐PQRS. [cite: 1759, 1762]
3.  Some measures are given in the adjacent figure. [cite_start]Find the area of ☐ABCD. [cite: 1767]

### Area of a Circle
The area of a circle can be found using its radius (r).

* [cite_start]**Formula**: Area = $\pi r^2$ [cite: 1860]

3.  The diameter of a circular garden is 42 m. There is a 3.5 m wide road around the garden. [cite_start]Find the area of the road. [cite: 1884]
4.  [cite_start]Find the area of a circle if its circumference is 88 cm. [cite: 1886]
