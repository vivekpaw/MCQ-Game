### 17. Circle - Chord and Arc

**Let's learn.**

### Properties of a Chord of a Circle

A **chord** is a line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circle. Chords have two key properties related to the center of the circle:

1.  [cite_start]**The perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle to its chord bisects the chord.** [cite: 1627] This means if a line from the center meets a chord at a 90° angle, it divides the chord into two equal parts.
2.  [cite_start]**The segment joining the centre of a circle and the midpoint of its chord is perpendicular to the chord.** [cite: 1639] This is the converse of the first property. If a line is drawn from the center to the exact middle of a chord, it will always be perpendicular to the chord.

These properties are often used with the Pythagorean theorem in a right-angled triangle formed by the radius, half the chord length, and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord.

**Practice Set 17.1**

1.  In a circle with centre P, chord AB is 13 cm long. If seg PQ is perpendicular to chord AB, find the length of QB.
2.  The radius of a circle with centre O is 25 cm. The length of a chord is 48 cm. Find the distance of the chord from the centre.
3.  O is the centre of a circle. A chord of length 24 cm is at a distance of 9 cm from the centre. Find the length of the radius.
4.  C is the centre of a circle whose radius is 10 cm. The length of a chord is 12 cm. Find the distance of the chord from the centre.

### Arcs Corresponding to a Chord
A chord divides a circle into two parts, a **minor arc** and a **major arc**. These are called the corresponding arcs of the chord.

**Congruent Arcs**
Two arcs are congruent if they have the same measure (i.e., the same central angle).

* [cite_start]**Property 1**: The chords corresponding to congruent arcs are congruent. [cite: 1738]
* [cite_start]**Property 2**: If two chords in a circle are congruent, then their corresponding minor and major arcs are also congruent. [cite: 1738]

**Practice Set 17.2**

1.  The diameters PQ and RS of a circle with centre C are perpendicular to each other. State why arc PS and arc SQ are congruent. Write the other arcs which are congruent to arc PS.
2.  In the adjoining figure, O is the centre of the circle. Measures of some central angles are given.
    * Find $m\angle AOB$ and $m\angle COD$.
    * Show that arc AB is congruent to arc CD.
    * Show that chord AB is congruent to chord CD.

### **Answers**

* **Practice Set 17.1**
    1.  6.5 cm
    2.  7 cm
    3.  15 cm
    4.  8 cm

* **Practice Set 17.2**
    1.  (1) Because the arcs have equal measures (90° each). (2) arc $PS \cong$ arc $PR \cong$ arc RQ.
    2.  (1) $m\angle AOB = m\angle COD = 45^{\circ}$. (2) Congruent because their measures are equal (45°). (3) Congruent because they are corresponding chords of congruent arcs.
