### 2. Parallel lines and transversal
---------------------------------------

**Let's recall.**

[cite_start]The lines in the same plane which do not intersect each other are called **parallel lines**[cite: 587]. [cite_start]The statement 'Line l and line m are parallel lines,' is written as 'line $l \parallel$ line $m$'[cite: 588].

**Let's learn.**

### Transversal
[cite_start]A **transversal** is a line that intersects two or more given lines in distinct points[cite: 601]. [cite_start]When a transversal intersects two lines, a total of eight angles are formed[cite: 604]. These angles are categorized into different pairs.


### Angle Pairs Formed by a Transversal
* [cite_start]**Corresponding angles**: A pair of angles where the arms on the transversal point in the same direction, and the other arms are on the same side of the transversal[cite: 607].
* [cite_start]**Interior angles**: A pair of angles that are on the same side of the transversal and are located between the two lines[cite: 617].
* [cite_start]**Alternate angles**: A pair of angles on opposite sides of the transversal, with their arms on the transversal pointing in opposite directions[cite: 633]. These can be further divided into:
    * [cite_start]**Interior alternate angles**: Angles on the inner side of the lines[cite: 638].
    * [cite_start]**Exterior alternate angles**: Angles on the outer side of the lines[cite: 639].

### Practice Set 2.1

        * **Corresponding angles:**
        * $\angle p$ and ☐
        * $\angle q$ and ☐
        * $\angle r$ and ☐
        * $\angle s$ and ☐
    * **Interior alternate angles:**
        * $\angle s$ and ☐
        * $\angle w$ and ☐

2.  [cite_start]Observe the angles shown in the figure and write the following pairs of angles[cite: 665].
        * (1) Interior alternate angles
    * (2) Corresponding angles
    * (3) Interior angles

### Properties of Angles with Parallel Lines

When a transversal intersects two **parallel lines**, the angles formed have special properties:
* [cite_start]Pairs of **corresponding angles** are congruent (equal in measure)[cite: 786].
* [cite_start]Pairs of **alternate angles** (both interior and exterior) are congruent[cite: 788].
* [cite_start]Pairs of **interior angles** on the same side of the transversal are supplementary (their sum is $180^{\circ}$)[cite: 787].

### Drawing Parallel Lines

[cite_start]**Construction (I):** To draw a line parallel to a given line through a point outside the line using set-squares[cite: 845, 846].
* **Steps:**
    1.  [cite_start]Draw line l and take a point P outside of it[cite: 848, 850].
    2.  [cite_start]Place two set-squares touching each other, with one edge of set-square A close to point P[cite: 851, 856].
    3.  [cite_start]Draw a line along the edge of the other set-square B[cite: 858]. [cite_start]This new line, m, is parallel to line l[cite: 861].

[cite_start]**Construction (II):** To draw a parallel line to a given line at a specified distance[cite: 876].
* **Steps (for a distance of 2.5 cm):**
    1.  [cite_start]Draw a line l and take two points, A and B, on it[cite: 881].
    2.  [cite_start]Draw lines perpendicular to line l from points A and B[cite: 889].
    3.  [cite_start]On these perpendiculars, mark points P and Q at a distance of 2.5 cm from A and B, respectively[cite: 892].
    4.  [cite_start]Draw a line through P and Q. This line is parallel to line l at a distance of 2.5 cm[cite: 893].
